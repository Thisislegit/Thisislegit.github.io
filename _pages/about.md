I am a third-year graduate student in the School of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/info/1015/1407.htm) at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, advised by Prof. [Kai Zheng](https://zheng-kai.com/) and [Han Su](https://ydri.uestc.edu.cn/info/1049/1041.htm). In 2020, I obtained my dual Bachelorâ€™s degrees in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and University of Glasgow (Graduated with First-class honor degree).

Research Interests
======
* Machine Learning for Query Optimization
  
  I'm dedicated to integrating traditional rule-based query optimization techniques with machine learning technology to develop an **efficient** (outperforming traditional databases), **autonomous** (requiring no human maintenance), and **practical** (applicable to real products) database query optimizer. This approach and philosophy can be extended to various modules within the database to ultimately form a fully autonomous database management system.
